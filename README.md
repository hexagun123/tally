This is a simple streak counter aimed to help with self-improvement
It is very basic right now, and since I'm a student, I also included a grade section
The main purpose of the streak counter is so that I know my progress, and gets addicted to my habbits, or in other words, this will help me create good, healthy habbits

The program is in very early stages of developement.
The next step is to add GUIs and checkboxes
